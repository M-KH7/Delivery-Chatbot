#	Project Title:  
Parcel Delivery Autonomous Robot Chatbot for scheduling appointments in recipient’s agenda.

#	Project Description:
Realizing a chatbot prototype for a Parcel Delivery Autonomous Robot. The chatbot shall consult the recipient (Outlook) agenda and suggest a delivery for 
the next available slot in the agenda together with a default location (if available in the recipient’s outlook entry) and wait for confirmation from the recipient. 
The recipient may ask for another time of day or another day or ask for a specific slot and location. When an agreement is reached the bot shall create an 
entry in the recipient agenda to schedule the delivery. In a second step, efforts can be made to integrate the chatbot in Teams and to automatically create 
entries in outlook calendars.
